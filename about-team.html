                <h2>Our Multidisciplinary Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    EcoNoctis Glasgow was developed by a diverse team of four students from the Singapore Institute of Technology, 
                    each bringing unique expertise to tackle the complex challenge of urban wildlife conservation. Our 
                    interdisciplinary approach combined technical skills with environmental science knowledge and user-centered 
                    design principles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working together over eight intensive weeks, we learned that successful conservation technology requires 
                    not just technical innovation, but also deep understanding of stakeholder needs, environmental science, 
                    and community engagement strategies.

                    <h3>Collaboration Methodology</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our team adopted an agile approach with weekly sprints, daily check-ins, and collaborative 
                        design sessions. We used a combination of in-person meetings and digital collaboration tools 
                        to maintain momentum across different schedules and time zones.

                    <h3>Communication Strategy</h3>
                    <p>
                        We established clear communication protocols using Slack for daily updates, Zoom for meetings, 
                        and Figma for collaborative design work. Regular retrospectives helped us identify and address 
                        collaboration challenges early.

                    <h3>Decision-Making Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        Major project decisions were made collectively through structured discussions and evidence-based 
                        evaluation. We used techniques like dot voting and impact-effort matrices to prioritize features 
                        and resolve disagreements constructively.

                    <h3>Communication is Everything</h3>
                    <p>
                        Clear, frequent communication prevented misunderstandings and kept everyone aligned on goals. 
                        Regular check-ins and transparent sharing of challenges led to better outcomes than trying 
                        to solve problems in isolation.

                    <p>
                        Having team members from different academic backgrounds led to more innovative and comprehensive 
                        solutions. Environmental science insights improved technical designs, while UX expertise 
                        made complex data more accessible.

                    <h3>Iteration Requires Trust</h3>
                    <p>
                        Willingness to receive feedback and iterate on ideas required building trust within the team. 
                        Creating a safe environment for constructive criticism led to dramatically better outcomes 
                        than our initial individual efforts.

                    <p>
                        While Sarah served as project lead, decision-making remained collaborative. Learning when 
                        to lead and when to follow based on expertise rather than hierarchy improved both our 
                        process and results.

                    <p>
                        While developed as an academic project, EcoNoctis Glasgow has generated genuine interest 
                        from Glasgow City Council for potential pilot implementation. Our approach demonstrates 
                        how student projects can address real-world challenges and contribute meaningful solutions 
                        to complex environmental problems.
