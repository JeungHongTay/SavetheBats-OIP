                    <p>
                        The tight 3-week timeline forced us to develop clear, frequent communication patterns. 
                        Regular check-ins during our scheduled tutor discussions and partner meetings prevented 
                        misunderstandings and kept everyone aligned on goals. We learned that transparent sharing 
                        of challenges leads to better outcomes than trying to solve problems in isolation.

                    <h3>Collaboration is Critical</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project highlighted just how important collaboration is in a large project. Each member 
                        had a specific role to play, and the project's success strongly depended on the six of us 
                        working together and giving it our all. The partner meetings and group sessions showed us 
                        that diverse perspectives lead to stronger solutions.

                    <p>
                        The prototyping and building sessions taught us that willingness to receive feedback and 
                        iterate on ideas required building trust within the team. Creating a safe environment for 
                        constructive criticism during our tutor discussions led to dramatically better outcomes 
                        than our initial individual efforts.

                    <h3>It's Okay to Let Go</h3>
                    <p>
                        We learned that not every idea will fit the project's needs, no matter how much effort 
                        went into it. Being able to let go of unsuitable concepts during our development phases 
                        allowed us to focus on stronger, more viable directions. Scrapping ideas isn't failure â€” 
                        it's part of progress.

                    <h3>What We're Proud Of</h3>
                    <p>
                        Looking back at this intensive three-week project, our team is proud of the solution we managed 
                        to develop despite the challenging timeline. Tackling the complex problem of bat conservation 
                        and light pollution in Glasgow required rapid iteration and a willingness to learn and adapt. 
                        We successfully navigated the challenges and arrived at a solution that we believe is both 
                        practical and meaningful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are particularly proud of how we handled the design process throughout the three weeks. 
                        From the initial intro sessions and contract exercises in Week 1, through the usability testing 
                        and partner meetings in Week 2, to the final exhibition preparation in Week 3, we showed 
                        professional maturity and a commitment to excellence. Rather than stubbornly clinging to 
                        initial ideas, we demonstrated willingness to iterate and adapt based on feedback from 
                        tutors and stakeholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tight timeline forced us to stay focused and make decisions quickly, but it also 
                        taught us the importance of prioritizing and trusting each other's strengths. We're proud 
                        that we stayed committed to seeing the project through to completion, even when motivation 
                        dipped or things felt uncertain. Our team continued to show up, contribute, and learn from 
                        our mistakes throughout all three weeks.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Not Proud Of -->
                <div class="reflection-card">
                    <div class="reflection-icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>What We're Not Proud Of</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our initial proposed solution had too broad a scope. We tried to incorporate both public 
                        education on the dangers of Artificial Lights at Night (ALAN) while also providing the 
                        data collection and visualization needed by our main stakeholder. In doing so, our solution 
                        suffered as a result â€” lacking focus, it did not effectively meet either goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After careful discussion during our Week 2 partner meetings and tutor sessions, we made 
                        the difficult decision to narrow our scope, scrap the prototype we had developed, and 
                        refocus our solution toward the core need of our main stakeholder: consistent and reliable 
                        data collection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While our project met its minimum requirements, we recognize that our team could have 
                        grown more in terms of collaboration and communication. At times, we struggled with 
                        unclear delegation, uneven participation, and unspoken assumptions about responsibilities. 
                        These issues led to delays, confusion, and moments of frustration during our development 
                        sessions. We placed too much emphasis on "just getting things done" and not enough on 
                        building a shared understanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project reminded us that soft skills such as empathy, active listening, and accountability 
                        are just as critical as technical ability. While our project managed to achieve the goal 
                        in the end on the technical side, more could be done in our collaborative side. Strengthening 
                        our team dynamics, building trust earlier, and fostering a more open and supportive environment 
                        could have improved not just the process, but also the overall experience for everyone involved.
                    </p>

                <!-- What I'd Do Differently -->
                <div class="reflection-card">
                    <div class="reflection-icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-redo-alt"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>What We Would Do Differently</h3>
                    <p>
                        If we could restart this project, the first change would be to define a clearer and more 
                        focused scope from the beginning. Our initial ambition to tackle both public education 
                        and stakeholder data needs stretched us too thin. With better prioritization early on, 
                        we could have avoided wasting time on features that were ultimately scrapped during our 
                        Week 2 pivot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also would have established stronger communication habits within the team from Week 1. 
                        Unclear delegation and unspoken assumptions often led to misunderstandings and uneven 
                        workloads during our development sessions. Setting clear expectations, defining roles early, 
                        and having more structured check-ins would have improved collaboration and team morale 
                        throughout the three weeks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, we would have taken better advantage of the scheduled tutor discussions 
                        and feedback sessions. While we attended these sessions, we could have been more proactive 
                        in seeking guidance and feedback earlier in the process, rather than waiting until we 
                        encountered problems.

                    <h3>Time Management</h3>
                    <p>The tight timeline taught us the importance of effective time management and prioritization. We learned to focus on what truly matters and let go of perfectionism.</p>

                    <h3>Iterative Design</h3>
                    <p>The prototyping sessions and usability testing taught us that good design comes from iteration and user feedback, not from perfect first attempts.</p>
