                        Clear, frequent communication prevented misunderstandings and kept everyone aligned on goals. 
                        Regular check-ins and transparent sharing of challenges can lead to better outcomes than trying 
                        to solve problems in isolation.

                        This project Highlighted to us just how important collaboration is in a large project. Each Member
                        had a part to play and the projects success strongly depended on the six of us working together and giving

                        Willingness to receive feedback and iterate on ideas required building trust within the team. 
                        Creating a safe environment for constructive criticism led to dramatically better outcomes 
                        than our initial individual efforts.

                        We learned that not every idea will fit the project's needs, no matter how much effort went into it. 
                        Being able to let go of unsuitable concepts allowed us to focus on stronger, more viable directions. 
                        Scrapping ideas isn’t failure — it’s part of progress.

                    <h3>What We're Proud Of</h3>
                    <p>
                        Looking back at this short three week project, our team is proud of the solution we managed to come up with.
                        Tackling the complex problem statement provided is not easy. However with rapid iteration, 
                        and a willingness to learn and adapt, we were able to navigate the challenges and arrive at a solution that we believe is both 
                        practical and meaningful. The tight timeline forced us to stay focused and make decisions quickly, but it also 
                        taught us the importance of prioritising and trusting each other’s strengths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are also proud of how the design process was handled. Rather than stubbornly clinging to the
                        initial idea, we showed willingness to scrap work already completed and completely shift the targeted
                        audience for the project which showed professional maturity and a commitment to excellence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the project had its fair share of challenges, we’re proud that we stayed committed to seeing it through to completion. 
                        Even when motivation dipped or things felt uncertain, our team continued to show up, contribute, and learn from our mistakes and that attitude showed
                        is something we are proud of.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What We're Not Proud Of</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our initial proposed solution had too broad a scope. We tried to incorporate both public education on the dangers
                        of Artificial Lights at Night (ALAN) while also providing the data collection and visualization needed by our main stakeholder.
                        In doing so, our solution suffered as a result — lacking focus, it did not effectively meet either goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After careful discussion, we made the difficult decision to narrow our scope, scrap the prototype we had developed,
                        and refocus our solution toward the core need of our main stakeholder: consistent and reliable data collection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While our project met its minimum requirements, we recognise that our team could have 
                        grown more in terms of collaboration and communication. At times, we struggled with unclear delegation, uneven 
                        participation, and unspoken assumptions about responsibilities. These issues led to delays, confusion, and moments of 
                        frustration. We placed too much emphasis on "just getting things done" and not enough on building a shared understanding.
                        This reminded us that soft skills such as empathy, active listening, and accountability are just as critical as technical ability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While our project managed to achieve the goal in the end on the technical side, more could be done in our collaborative side.
                        Strengthening our team dynamics, building trust earlier, and fostering a more open and supportive environment could have 
                        improved not just the process, but also the overall experience for everyone involved. This project reminded us that 
                        successful outcomes aren’t just about functionality but are also about how well we work together to get there.
                    </p>

                    <div class="reflection-icon">

                    <h3>What We Would Do Differently</h3>
                    <p>
                        If we could restart this project, the first change would be to define a clearer and more focused scope from the beginning. 
                        Our initial ambition to tackle both public education and stakeholder data needs stretched us too thin. With better 
                        prioritisation early on, we could have avoided wasting time on features that were ultimately scrapped.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also would have established stronger communication habits within the team. Unclear delegation and unspoken assumptions 
                        often led to misunderstandings and uneven workloads. Setting clear expectations, defining roles early, and having 
                        structured check-ins would have improved collaboration and team morale.
